## [Unreleased] - 0.3.13

### Added
-

### Fixed
- `BanSubstrings` scanner to handle substrings with special characters.

### Changed
- `Gibberish` scanner has higher threshold to reduce false positives. In addition, it supports changing `labels` to remove overtriggering when `mild gibberish` is detected.
- `BanCode` scanner was improved to trigger less false-positives.

### Removed
-

## [0.3.12] - 2024-04-23

### Added
- Lazy loading of models in the API deployment. Now you can start loading models when the first request comes.
- Support for `gunicorn` in the API deployment.
- `NoRefusalLight` scanner that uses a common set of phrases to detect refusal as per research papers.
- `Anonymize` and `Sensitive` scanners have a support of [lakshyakh93/deberta_finetuned_pii](https://huggingface.co/lakshyakh93/deberta_finetuned_pii) model.
- `BanCode` scanner to detect and block code snippets in the prompt.
- Benchmarks on the AMD CPU.
- `API` has a new endpoint `POST /scan/prompt` to scan the prompt without sanitizing it. It is faster than the `POST /analyze/scan` endpoint.
- Example of running [LLM Guard with ChatGPT streaming mode](./tutorials/openai.md) enabled.
- `API` supports loading models from the local folder.

### Fixed
- `InvisibleText` scanner to allow control characters like `\n`, `\t`, etc.

### Changed
- **[Breaking]**: Introducing `Model` object for better customization of the models.
- Updated all libraries
- Introduced `revision` for all models to ensure the same model is used for the same revision.
- `Code` scanner to rely on the output if there is no Code in the prompt.
- `BanTopics`, `FactualConsistency`: support of the [new zero-shot-classification models](https://huggingface.co/collections/MoritzLaurer/zeroshot-classifiers-6548b4ff407bb19ff5c3ad6f).
- `PromptInjection` can support more match types for better accuracy.
- `API` relies on the lighter models for faster inference but with a bit lower accuracy. You can remove the change and build from source to use the full models.
- `PromptInjection` scanned uses the [new v2 model](https://huggingface.co/protectai/deberta-v3-base-prompt-injection-v2) for better accuracy.

### Removed
- `model_kwargs` and `pipeline_kwargs` as they are part of the `Model` object.

## [0.3.10] - 2024-03-14

### Added
- **Anonymize**: New NER models from AI4Privacy [Isotonic/distilbert_finetuned_ai4privacy_v2](https://huggingface.co/Isotonic/distilbert_finetuned_ai4privacy_v2) and [Isotonic/deberta-v3-base_finetuned_ai4privacy_v2](https://huggingface.co/Isotonic/deberta-v3-base_finetuned_ai4privacy_v2).
- [Gibberish](https://llm-guard.com/input_scanners/gibberish/) scanner to check if the text contains gibberish.
- Ability to load models from local folders instead of pulling them from HuggingFace.

### Fixed
-

### Changed

### Removed
-

- Add [NIST Taxonomy](./get_started/attacks.md) to the documentation.
- Pass HuggingFace Transformers `pipeline` `kwargs` for better control over the models. For example, `BanTopics(topics=["politics", "war", "religion"], transformers_kwargs={"low_cpu_mem_usage": True})` for better memory usage when handling big models.
- `API`: rate limiting.
- `API`: HTTP basic authentication and API key authentication.
- `API`: OpenTelemetry support for tracing and metrics.

- Using `structlog` for better logging.
- **[Breaking]**: `Code`: using new model [philomath-1209/programming-language-identification](https://huggingface.co/philomath-1209/programming-language-identification) with more languages support and better accuracy. Please update your `languages` parameter.
- `API`: ONNX is enabled by default.
- `protobuf` version is not capped to v3.
- `API` uses `pyproject.toml` for dependencies and builds.
- **[Breaking]**: `API` configuration changes with separate sections for `auth`, `rate_limit` and `cache`.

### Removed
- Roadmap documentation as it's not up-to-date.

## [0.3.7] - 2023-01-15

_0.3.5 and 0.3.6 were skipped due to build issues._

### Added
- [URLReachability](https://llm-guard.com/output_scanners/url_reachability/) scanner to check if the URL is reachable.
- [BanCompetitors](https://llm-guard.com/input_scanners/ban_competitors/) scanner to check if the prompt or output contains competitors' names.
- [InvisibleText](https://llm-guard.com/input_scanners/invisible_text/) scanner to check if the prompt contains invisible unicode characters (steganography attack).

### Changed
- Using `pyproject.toml` instead of `setup.py` based on the [request](https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard/issues/68).

- **[Breaking]** `BanSubstrings`: `match_type` parameter became `Enum` instead of `str`.
- **[Breaking]** `Code` scanners have a new signature. It accepts `languages` and `is_blocked` instead of 2 separate lists.
- `Toxicity`, `PromptInjection`, `Bias` and `Language` scanners support sentence match for better accuracy (will become slower).
- `BanTopics`, `FactualConsistency` and `NoRefusal`: Updated zero-shot classification model to [hMoritzLaurer/deberta-v3-base-zeroshot-v1.1-all-33](https://huggingface.co/MoritzLaurer/deberta-v3-base-zeroshot-v1.1-all-33) with different size options.
- **[Breaking]**: Using keyword arguments for better readability of the code e.g. `scanner = BanSubstrings(["a", "b", "c"], "str", False, True, False)` would raise an error.
- **[Breaking]**: API config supports configuring same scanner multiple times with different inputs.
