You can check if all elements of `list_of_strings` exist in `available_strings` by converting both lists to sets and then using the set's `issubset` method.

Here's a simple example:

```python
list_of_strings = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
available_strings = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "fig"]

# Convert lists to sets
set_of_strings = set(list_of_strings)
set_of_available = set(available_strings)

# Check if all elements of list_of_strings exist in available_strings
all_exist = set_of_strings.issubset(set_of_available)

print(all_exist)  # This will print True if all elements exist, False otherwise

This approach takes advantage of the set's properties to efficiently check for membership.""",
